              <p>
                Natural farming is a chemical free farming rooted in Indian
                tradition enriched with modern and standing of ecology resource
                cycling and on farm resource optimisation. It is considered as
                agrichology based diversified farming system which integrated
                crops trees and livestock with functional biodiversity it is
                largely based on on form biomass recycling with Images Useds press and
                biomas mulching use of on farm cowden urine formulations
                maintaining soil erosion and exclusion of all synthetic chemical
                inputs natural farming is expected to reduce dependency on
                purchased inputs it is considered as the cost effective farming
                practice with scope for increasing employment and rural
                development.

                <p>
                  Natural farming aims at restoring soil health, maintenance of
                  diversity, ensure animal welfare, stress on efficient use of
                  natural/local resources and promote ecological fairness.
                  Natural farming is an ecological farming approach where
                  farming system works with the natural biodiversity,
                  encouraging the soil's biological activity and managing the
                  complexity of living organisms both plant and animal to thrive
                  along with food production system.Important practices,

                <strong>Scope of Natural Farming</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many working models of natural farming all over the
                world, the zero budget natural farming (ZBNF) is the most
                popular model in India. Natural Farming improves soil fertility,
                environmental health as well as helps in the reduction of
                greenhouse gas emissions and also promises the enhancement of
                farmer's income. In broad terms, Natural Farming can be
                considered as a prominent strategy to save the planet Earth for
                future generations. It has the potential to manage the various
                farmland practices and hence sequester the atmospheric carbon in
                the soils and plants, to make it available for plants.

                <strong>Importance of Natural Farming</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Several studies have reported the effectiveness of natural
                farming in terms of increase in production, sustainability,
                saving of water use, improvement in soil health and farmland
                ecosystem. It is considered as a cost-effective farming
                practices with scope for raising employment and rural
                development. Natural Farming offers a solution to various
                problems, such as food insecurity, farmers' distress, and health
                problems arising due to pesticide and fertilizer residue in food
                and water, global warming, climate change and natural
                calamities. It also has the potential to generate employment,
                thereby stemming the migration of rural youth. Natural Farming,
                as the name suggests, is the art, practice and, increasingly,
                the science of working with nature to achieve much more with
                less.

                <strong>
                  The world of Natural Farming- Cattle and non- Cattle based
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The cattle-based farming is cow-based farming which is
                considered as boon for sustainable agriculture. Cow-based
                farming results in the conservation of natural resources, soil,
                water and lives. Even the water and electricity requirements are
                reduced by 90% in this manner, lowering the cultivation cost to
                a bare minimum. This method would also utilize only 10% of the
                irrigation water in the farming practice. Also, because there is
                less power consumption, there is less pollution and also there
                are several advantages to embracing cow-based farming.

                <li>
                  1. Improve Yield Farmers practicing Natural Farming reported
                  similar yields to those following conventional farming. In
                  several cases, higher yields per harvest were also reported.

                <li>
                  2. Ensures Better Health: As Natural Farming does not use any
                  synthetic chemicals, health risks and hazards are eliminated.
                  The food has higher nutrition density and therefore offers
                  better health benefits.

                <li>
                  3. Environment Conservation:-Natural Farming ensures better
                  soil biology, improved agro-biodiversity and a more judicious
                  usage of water with much smaller carbon and nitrogen
                  footprints.

                <li>
                  4. Increased Farmers' Income:-Natural Farming aims to make
                  farming viable and aspirational by increasing net incomes of
                  farmers on account of cost reduction, reduced risks, similar
                  yields, incomes from intercropping.
